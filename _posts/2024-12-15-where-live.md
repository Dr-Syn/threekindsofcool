we welcome those who work, the good proclaim,<br>
to build this brave new world - you'll have to bleed<br>
your tears, your sweat, and what remains<br>
is yours to build your life and what you need!<br>
<br>
so come and work, and spend your days in toil,<br>
to build for us empyrian delights - <br>
you'll build a bright new day! the good extol,<br>
and never mind for where you spend your nights.<br>
<br>
they'll say they welcome those who travel far,<br>
their willing hands outstretched with work to give,<br>
but once the work is done they shut their door - <br>
this place is just for work, and not to live -<br>
<br>
for tho across the lands and seas you've roamed,<br>
to build their dreams, they'll never build your home.
