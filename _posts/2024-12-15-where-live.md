we welcome those who work, the good proclaim,
to build this brave new world - you'll have to bleed
your tears, your sweat, and what remains
is yours to build your life and what you need!

so come and work, and spend your days in toil,
to build for us empyrian delights - 
you'll build a bright new day! the good extol,
and never mind for where you spend your nights.

they'll say they welcome those who travel far,
their willing hands outstretched with work to give,
but once the work is done they shut their door - 
this place is just for work, and not to live -

for tho across the lands and seas you've roamed,
to build their dreams, they'll never build your home.
