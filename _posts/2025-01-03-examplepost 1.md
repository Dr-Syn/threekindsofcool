sometimes broken things can be beautiful from the breaking<br>
poet, know this: thy heart shall be made full from the breaking <br>
<br>
bird-song outside the window heralds the new day's dawning<br>
a cloud covers the sun; there is a lull from the breaking<br>
<br>
sea-wrack and driftwood line the beach at the high tide's margin<br>
thus far and no farther, crashing waves fall from the breaking<br>
<br>
the tongues of the joyful chimes have fallen silent and still <br>
their bright brazen outburst cracked from the toll of the breaking<br>
<br>
promises of eternity lie in a rose embrace<br>
whisper: will fruit follow when petals fall from the breaking? <br>
<br>
silence surrounds me as I look upon eyes of judgement<br>
is paradise before, or only hell, from the breaking?<br>
<br>
fever dreams of salvation whirl delirious, gleaming<br>
cleared away, Niamh's eyes see past the world's shell from the breaking
