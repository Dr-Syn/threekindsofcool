your ghost still haunts me when I want to share<br>
a joy which oftentimes we'd shared before,<br>
a snatch of song that tastes the morning air<br>
or verse or prose of which you'd have adored<br>
<br>
a stumble in my reading, and I curse<br>
the lack of thee within my daily scope, <br>
then sigh, a lack of breath that shears<br>
you from my mind again, a parted hope<br>
<br>
but would your smile bring to my heart a pang<br>
of joy or pain or - here I cut the thread:<br>
no matter what the might-have-beens will claim<br>
the sunrise shows again an empty bed.<br>
<br>
a few handfuls of tears are, at the best,<br>
the spirits that I'll offer for your rest
