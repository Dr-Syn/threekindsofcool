runes scribed by sunlight through stirring leaves, she enchants<br>
wind-swirled, they change - but meaning still cleaves; she enchants<br>
<br>
a sursurration whispers mantras of rainfall<br>
eyes flash, and with thundering, it leaves; she ends chants<br>
<br>
candleflame redoubles, divides, eyes glistening<br>
with - what? the flicker of flame yet breathes; she enchants<br>
<br>
the weight of stars slumps westward, hauling up the sun<br>
dawning early, time from moonlight thieved; she enchants<br>
<br>
smiling enigma, fortune rolls her wheel onwards<br>
none anticipate what fates she weaves, she and chance<br>
<br>
in her slow regard, she changes raiment to black<br>
her death and rebirth she monthly grieves, she enchants<br>
<br>
here the winter-cold iron lays still on the hillside;<br>
there the harvest piles high in its sheaves; sidhe enchants<br>
<br>
wine served by her hands brings sweeter taste to my lips<br>
her touch sacramental blessings leaves; she enchants<br>
<br>
an withal new perspective circumstance then grants,<br>
ever shall you speak these words of Niamh's she enchants
