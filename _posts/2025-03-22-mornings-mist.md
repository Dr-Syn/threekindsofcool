the sunlight's golden rays have cleaved the morning's mist;<br>
the cold salt-marsh below has breathed the morning's mist<br>
<br>
the midnight oil is burned for my thoughts' revolving,<br>
only with the sunrise will come sleep; the morning's missed<br>
<br>
headstones silent lie beneath light of coldest stars<br>
their names remain unread; unseen, the mourning missed.<br> 
<br>
the soothing breath of spring above the melting snow;<br>
the fiddleheads comb dewy gleams, the morning's mist<br>
<br>
a cry that rends the night within a darkened room;<br>
lamp-light shimmers in the eaves the mourning's missed<br>

a snatch of song, a whispered vow, your eyes I see<br>
within my heart - but only dreams the morning missed. <br>
<br>
tomorrow comes; she shines upon the world below;<br>
auric blessings on all she sees, the morning's mist.<br>
<br>
for you the Moon who shines above, a partnership;<br>
and so for me, I shall be be Niamh, the Morning's miss.
