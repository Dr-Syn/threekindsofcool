when I was young I was told, "share and share alike" - <br>
but never what it meant, if you can share alike.<br>
<br>
a glass of wine gives ruddy glow to lips and cheek,<br>
tho half-consumed, redoubled joy when shared alike<br>
<br>
beloved, eyes of amber seige my fertile mind -<br>
my heart's tilled within your gaze, sword and share alike<br>
<br>
master I must with midnight oil this thirst for bayts,<br>
from others' verse, I ghazal deep, and sher alike <br>
<br>
"a loaf of bread, a jug of wine, and thou" besides,<br>
abundant joys together we can share alike<br>
<br>
fortune's bonds upon the wheel hold it tight and fast;<br>
and yet it turns, escaped from cache and share alike<br>
<br>
we both look up when moonshine glints on evening's brow<br>
and sing a part of the same song, then share alike<br>
<br>
a sudden gasp, we cling together urgently -<br>
then my breath is yours is mine now, when shared alike<br>
<br>
another dawn dissolves the mists in golden light,<br>
following Niamh, to summer I'll then share alike
