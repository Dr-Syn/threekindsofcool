where once your name brought joy within my heart<br>
a numbing cold now takes hold of my chest;<br>
where once with eager drumming it would start<br>
now skips a beat - and hangs there in arrest<br>



where once a smile would seize me unawares<br>
is now a blankness, paralyzed and still;<br>
a mind in stasis, seeing just nightmares,<br>
and of your laugh is now unending chill.<br>


where once was speech, my ear now silence hears;<br>
where once your hand my hand would grasp with care - <br>
a gasp, a pause, and then a breath to clear<br>
the apparition of the past from there. <br>

for tho you turned my heart around to lead<br>
my love, my feelings ever constant read
