where once your name brought joy within my heart

a numbing cold now takes hold of my chest;

where once with eager drumming it would start

now skips a beat - and hangs there in arrest



where once a smile would seize me unawares

is now a blankness, paralyzed and still;

a mind in stasis, seeing just nightmares,

and of your laugh is now unending chill.



where once was speech, my ear now silence hears;

where once your hand my hand would grasp with care - 

a gasp, a pause, and then a breath to clear

the apparition of the past from there. 



for tho you turned my heart around to lead

my love, my feelings ever constant read
