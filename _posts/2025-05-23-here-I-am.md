unlooked-for, perhaps, but present, this: here I am<br>
sand sieves out the grip of clench√©d fist - here, I am<br>
<br>
your eyes turn towards horizons only you can see,<br>
but behind you I can stand, insist: here I am<br>
<br>
my fields lay in fallow rest for seasons' stirrings;<br>
now carve we furrows in springtime mist; here, I am<br>
<br>
a yawning gulf of endless deep these stars divide;<br>
look on them! their light can coexist: here, I am<br>
<br>
the sound your footstep makes imprinted in my ear;<br>
heartbeats in your time, there anapest, here iamb<br>
<br>
my eyes have blurred with tears and stained the printed page;<br>
for those words you wrote, but there you kissed - here I am!<br>
<br>
a quiet room and dim, a silent breath that stirs;<br>
the softest whisper would not be missed - here I am <br>
<br>
shall I forget you - no, not forget, but not think;<br>
your absence brings sharper emphasis - here I am!<br>
<br>
a line is drawn, no further can Niamh go than this:<br>
whether joyous shout or damning hiss, here I am
