the cold wind gnaws around the eaves, can you feel the bite?<br>
deep in my bones it creeps and scalpel-wields the bite<br>
<br>
a shy smile flashed 'neath lowered lids on sunny morn<br>
a shadow flickers, fades, returns, reveals the bite<br>
<br>
with plenty are the tables laid as each brings out <br>
their best to offer each, abundant meals to bite<br>
<br>
temptation stirs and beckons forth a hungry sigh;<br>
feasts before me bare are laid, shall I steal the bite? <br>
<br>
a highlit gleam, the sun's caress on shoulder set<br>
'gainst sliding shadows, muscles flexed to feel the bite<br>
<br>
a surgeon's touch wounds to excise a mortal blow;<br>
with piercing gaze the shattered self can heal the bite<br>
<br>
gaze you to me, reversing now my own intent? <br>
come show me, as you dare, and I shall yield the bite<br>
<br>
with royal hue bedecked on sovereign arms I bear;<br>
these presents unto all I show your seal: the bite<br>

cold stars above redouble chill without your sight,<br>
cold iron shall sidhe bear, an Niamh shall feel the bite
