don't give to me a promise with your speech<br>
as words lie round me, fallen from a mouth<br>
that spake of joy and gladness that we each<br>
could find within each others' guise of truth<br>
<br>
don't give to me a promise with your pen<br>
whose inky blots sketched out a happy scene<br>
with glee and pain entwined, which well you ken<br>
in knowing my desires, passions' gleam<br>
<br>
don't give to me a promise with your mind<br>
the best intent will reap the whirlwind's blast<br>
as fates will laugh when mortal plans unwind<br>
and this appointed disappointment cast<br>
<br>
but give to me a promise with your eyes,<br>
and show me in their depths where passion lies
