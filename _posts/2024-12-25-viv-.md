so by provoking spiro spero's doom, <br>
that mockery of hope, you think to win<br>
the passions of the people half-entombed<br>
within the stricture you've defined as sin? <br>
<br>
one hand the leash that chokes off every joy<br>
and leaves only the musts, the shalts, the nots-<br>
the other dangles Tantalus's branch,<br>
but out of reach and dead, its fruits will rot. <br>
<br>
so what is hope if you're denied a breath,<br>
reward eternal plucked out from your reach <br>
and promised to you only after death<br>
removes all chance to mend that contract's breach?<br>
<br>
if contented life is what you hope to live<br>
beware of hope when wielded as a shiv
