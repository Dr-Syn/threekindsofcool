look into my eyes and tell me, what do you know?<br>
a heavy sigh, glance away, lids shut - do you know?<br>
<br>
we walked amid blossom-scented breeze this morning;<br>
there will be thyme when the sun cuts the dew, you know.<br>
<br>
stillness and silence answer a prayer in the night - <br>
is it refusal? unheard? or - what? do you know?<br>
<br>
suspended, the moon hangs between this day and next<br>
to the horizon she falls towards - what, do you know?<br>
<br>
I list, my world askew as your words reach my ears;<br>
unknowing I sit; are we now shut, do - you know.<br>
<br>
the sun rises again, as before and now since - <br>
the world moves as she always has, what do you know.<br>
<br>
we dance in our own step, different drummers hearing,<br>
shall your footsteps across my path cut, do you know?<br>
<br>
razor-edged, time divides what was from what wasn't<br>
meant to be in its own season, cuts, do you - no.<br>
<br>
the mind thinks, the heart feels, and between these two poles<br>
there I sit to take your Niamh and - what, do you know?
