One of the things on my mind is how the kind of 'trans rights' that I'm most interested in are less about individual, specific affirmations - the right to use a public bathroom; the right to have appropriate medical care for our needs; the right to find employment without being discriminated against -

and more about a desire to be unremarkable.

Because, yeah, trans people kinda stand out right now. Most of the population is not familiar with us, and the way we get spoken about is in an exceptionalizing, othering tone.

But we're just people.

Every time someone tells me that I'm 'awesome' or 'brave' my heart sinks a little bit because they're kinda putting me up on a pedestal and idealizing me as a Revolutionary Figure.

I'm a person. Just the same as you.

Transition, in my mind, is something that can be a journey of great significance to the person transitioning,

but to everyone else?

Why do you care. You're not the one on the trip. You'll get the vacation photos and forget about it next week.

Transition should be boring, like your cousin's last trip to Tampa. Sure, it meant a lot to her, but there's only so many times you can hear about that great little place down on the beach where she keeps finding the most amazing margaritas.

I want a world in which my status as a trans woman is *boring trivia*.

The kind of thing that people honestly don't give a shit about.

I want to be boring, not brave.

If you're going to cast me in the starring role in a movie in your mind, then let it be a cyberpunk thriller where my habit of teaching random people how to pick locks becomes load-bearing to a heist or something.

Not because I happened to be born with a medical condition.

Yes, transition has been amazing and life changing for me and I will be thoroughly enjoying it for the rest of my life.

I also do things with my life besides HRT injections; we can talk about those things too. Preferentially, even.

Make me boring. That's the rights I want.
