what's read can mean other than what's writ, who's to say?<br>
what life words live when spoken or heard? choose to say -<br>
<br>
a mind in motion bears aloft a shining prize; <br>
arrest and pause, hang in suspense - it moves to say -<br>
<br>
sunlight and shadow mix upon a grassy hill;<br>
either welcomes - or climb a tree! - and choose to say - <br>
<br>
what witnessed you that night with glinting starlit eyes;<br>
a cry half-heard, half-smothered - joy? or who's to say -<br>
<br>
the legacy of times gone by carved deep in rock;<br>
you peer amidst the scattered stones and muse to say -<br>
<br>
what mysteries the moonlight pulls from out the earth;<br>
half-hid, her light reveals, or conceals, clues to say -<br>
<br>
between the cup and lip disaster often lurks;<br>
proverbs caution, but slips can yield a sooth to say -<br>
<br>
these alloys quenched will darken from a ruddy glow;<br>
a cup of red will brighten eyes, brews to say -<br>
<br>
thrice woven threads about her summon forth the fae;<br>
what weal or woe Niamh spins? then ask her: who's to say?
