some fun neologisms:

ambirogate - derived from ambi- and rogare; "to ask around"

quasirogate - from quasi- and rogare, would literally mean 'to almost ask', but it suggests that situation where someone is clearly trying to ask a question but will not spit it out.

abnitiate - a contraction of 'ab initio', "to create from first principles" - it's a bit stronger than the concept of bootstrapping, in that it presupposes not only that the thing needs to be built from scratch, but that you don't have the tools or parts from the end result available for building it. think of, for instance, how you'd build The First Lathe without having any screws or other parts that would be relatively easy to make with a lathe.
