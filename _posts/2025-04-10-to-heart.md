whispering breeze subtle with salt, take it to heart - <br>
soul of my soul, hear now these words; take it to heart<br>
<br>
tidal-washed sands trace where your step passed hurriedly<br>
until the seas' covetous grasp takes it to heart.<br>
<br>
witness the sun dapple your skin foliage-bent -<br>
where shadows meet, so would my lips - make it two, heart.<br>
<br>
loosed from the hand, shattering glass echoes the room;<br>
whether a cheer - whether a curse - take it to heart.<br>
<br>
calamitous, shrill, hammering hard, roar in my ears - <br>
quiet, a gift, deep from within - take it, to heart.<br>
<br>
hand in my hand, I felt your breath coupled with mine - <br>
parted, your lips; parting your words - break it, too, heart.<br>

give me a sign, I cry at dusk, lowering light<br>
hides your return - so I must trust; take it to heart.<br>

your eye holds mine; your ears my words; tell me your mind - <br>
make your words cruel, lingered suspense: stake it to heart.<br>

rise with the dawn exulting sun and sing your part - <br>
love may yet live this summer's Niamh - take it to heart.
