the blanket of new snow has kept the fallen leaves;<br>
the scattered pages have been swept; the fallen leaves<br>
<br>
where once my heart stood as an oak dressed all in green<br>
winter holds again, sere, wind-wrecked; the fallen leaves<br>
<br>
my manuscript has come unbound; how my mind reels!<br>
memory holds me in contempt, the fallen leaves<br>
<br>
there is no sin nor sinner when her eye has seen<br>
souls shed them before her, exempt, the fallen leaves<br>
<br>
the devil on my shoulder takes his leave of me<br>
there's nothing left in here to tempt; the fallen leaves<br>
<br>
so scatter yarrow, tell a fortune, pour out tea;<br>
you'll find Niamh within, I expect, the fallen leaves
