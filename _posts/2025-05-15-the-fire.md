my tools arrayed within my forge, I light the fire<br>
my thoughts from pen to page have strayed despite the fire<br>
<br>
your ardor cooled, blocked, damped my breath; desire gutters -<br>
only embers have I left to ignite the fire<br>
<br>
your smile flint-grounded dressed stone ramparts gleaming bright<br>
so steel me with your strike and we shall light the fire<br>
<br>
all around is ash burnt grey and sere, nothing stirs<br>
bare and wasted are the grounds where you fight the fire<br>
<br>
depart from me and go into lands unknowing<br>
return, my pillars stand by day; at night the fire<br>
<br>
without your breath against my ear no thought may stir<br>
the candle snuffed within the jar that blights the fire<br>
<br>
alone a watch I keep above a sea of green <br>
alarm bells shall I strike if I can sight the fire<br>
<br>
with wine-dark dreams the sun recedes at eventide<br>
so we in darkness can bring forth delight: the fire<br>
<br>
the moon fae-touched in mourning dimness shall retire<br>
so her countenance Niamh shall take - and bright, the fire.
