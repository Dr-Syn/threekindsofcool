a job that is worth doing can face half-assing<br>
a love of ages' song is well-praised half-assing<br>

exquisite presentation graces the table<br>
every dish ends up in the same place - half-assing<br>
<br>
iridescent shining bedecks haughty plumage - <br>
dull ones eat the same breadcrumbs, no waste half-assing<br>
<br>
perfection's golden gleam of a high-walled city -<br>
let yourself be rid of gilt; embrace half-assing<br>
<br>
constant striving sends you over the finish line<br>
but I will finish in the same place half-assing<br>
<br>
a job half-done's well begun for the days' passing;<br>
you will, Niamh, err on the side of grace, half-assing
